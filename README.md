## About

This repository includes practical files covering a wide range of topics within Deep Learning, such as:

- **Neural Networks**: Building, training, and evaluating neural networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Implementing CNNs for image classification and recognition tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Working with sequential data, including time series and natural language processing.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Exploring GANs for generating synthetic data.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models for specific tasks.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Implementing and experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms.

Each practical file is well-documented with clear instructions, code, and results. The repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in Deep Learning.
